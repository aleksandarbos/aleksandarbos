### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alex, and I'm a software engineer with a passion for building high-quality software applications. I have extensive experience in various technologies, including .NET, Python, JavaScript, React, and React Native and many others.

ðŸ‘¯ In the past, I worked at a university, where I taught web technologies. Since then, I've been focusing on taking on projects and components that I can work on independently. Recently, I published a [repository](https://github.com/aleksandarbos/solutions-for-data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python) that includes resolved tasks from the book "Python Algorithms and Data Structures.". It's a great way to showcase my coding skills, and I invite you to check it out.

I'm not the biggest fan of typed languages, but can be easly convinced the other way around (especially for big projects!!) ðŸ˜„. 

Aside from coding, I have a keen interest in psychology and nature ðŸŒ±. I love traveling, surfing, and occasionally playing the piano. 

ðŸ’¬ If you're interested in collaborating on a project or discussing software development, feel free to reach out.
